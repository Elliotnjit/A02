How to Use GitHub: A Tutorial Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide on using GitHub, focusing on creating a repository, and documenting knowledge on Git, WebStorm, and GitHub. This tutorial is designed for beginners and includes a glossary of essential terms for quick reference.

Part 1: Creating a GitHub Repository
Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you haven't already, sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/. Follow the on-screen instructions to create and verify your account.


Step 2: Create a New Repository
Once logged in, navigate to the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select New repository.
Name your repository A02, ensuring to use a capital "A" as it is case-sensitive.
Optionally, you can add a description for your repository.
Choose whether the repository will be public or private.
Initialize the repository with a README file by checking the corresponding box. This is crucial as it allows you to immediately clone the repository and add more content.
Click Create repository.
Step 3: Customize the README.MD
In your repository, click on the README.MD file.
Click the pencil icon to edit the file.
Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub. Provide step-by-step instructions, use bullet points for clarity, and include links to any external resources or downloads needed.
Make sure to commit your changes with a clear message, such as "Updated README with tutorial content."
Step 4: Submit Repository Link
Share your repository link on Canvas for submission. The format should look like this: https://github.com/yourUCID/A02.


Part 2: Directions on Using WebStorm
WebStorm is a powerful IDE for modern JavaScript development, perfect for working with Git and GitHub projects. Here’s how to set it up:

Download and Install WebStorm: Visit the JetBrains website at https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/ and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.

Configure Git: Within WebStorm, go to File > Settings (or WebStorm > Preferences on macOS) > Version Control > Git. Ensure you have Git installed and specify the path to the Git executable.

Clone a Repository: Use WebStorm’s VCS operations to clone your GitHub repository by selecting VCS > Checkout from Version Control > Git and entering your repository URL.

Work on Your Project: Create, edit, and manage your project files within WebStorm. Utilize its coding assistance, analysis, and other features to enhance your workflow.

Commit and Push Changes: Right-click on the project folder, select Git > Commit Directory to commit changes. Write a commit message and press Commit. To push changes to GitHub, right-click again, select Git > Push.


Part 3: Glossary
Branch: A parallel version of a repository. It diverges from the main work and is used for work on a new feature or bug fix.
Clone: A copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server.
Commit: An individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like saving a file, but with a timestamp and a note about what you changed.
Fetch: Downloading changes from a remote repository to your local repo, but not integrating them into your work.
GIT: An open-source distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
GitHub: A web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It allows for collaboration on projects.
Merge: The act of taking the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork) and integrating them into another.
Merge Conflict: Occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
Push: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
Pull: Fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.
Remote: A version of your repository hosted on a server, typically GitHub.
Repository: A directory or storage space where your projects can live. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host.
